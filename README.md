# WHAT

This is my solution of the practice problems on many online judge about Data Structure and Algorithm

# NOTE
- The template.cpp is a template for C++ competitive programming problems
- Complie command with the gcc flag options
``
g++ -Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -std=c++2a -o complied.bin
``
	Explain:
		- ``-Wall`` enables all warnings. Highly recommend using this flags.
		- ``-Wextra`` enables extra warnings.
		- ``-Wno-sign-conversion`` silences sign conversion warnings for code like ``x < vec.size()``
		- ``-Wshadow`` enables shadowing warnings, so that if you define another variable with the same name in a local scope, you will get a warning.
